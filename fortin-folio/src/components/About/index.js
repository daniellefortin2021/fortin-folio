            <p>With over five years of experience managing websites, developing and maintaining brands, managing social media, and developing communication strategies, I am a seasoned digital media strategist with a strong interest in working with small businesses and non-profit organizations. Based in Cleveland, OH, I am interested in helping companies and organizations build their communication plans and brands from the ground up. Outside of work I am a serial hobbyist. You can find me either rollerblading at the park, at home crocheting and watching a cheesy movie, taking my dog for a hike, or at the pottery studio.</p>
